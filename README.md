# Complex Agent Behavior - Unity
 As part of the final group project for CS443: Topics in Computer Science - Character Animation, my group created a system that has a complex agent behavior for 4 pursuers searching for the player evader object. The base for this project was using navmeshes, destination path-tracing, and trigger-based detection to have automatic patrols for the pursuers, detection radius for each pursuer when finding the evader, and dynamic pathfinding when chasing the evader. Additionally, the player controls the evader capsule, using WASD to move and shift to Sprint (sprinting drops bolts behind him acting as a trail for the pursuers to potentially follow).

Group: Aditya Oka, Jeancarlo Bolanos, and Andrey Efremchev
